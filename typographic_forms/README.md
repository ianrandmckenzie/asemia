Sidenote: rules.json only need to exist with bodies and joins?

## Bodies

### Short

* Straight: Exists as a straight vertical line that can be rotated 90 degrees to serve as horizontal
* 45ยบ Angled: Exists as a straight 45 degree diagonal line that can be rotated 90 degrees for orienting its polar counterpart.

### Long

* Straight: Exists as a straight vertical line that can be rotated 90 degrees to serve as horizontal
* 22.5ยบ Angled: Exists as a straight 22.5 degree diagonal line.
  * Spans 1x2 columns.
  * Can be mirrored by -100% for orienting its polar counterpart.
  * Can be rotated (across 1x2 columns) by 90 degrees for creating its horizontal counterpart
  * When mirrored -100% and rotated 90 degrees, it can fill the last possible available orientation.
* 45ยบ Angled: Exists as a straight 45 degree diagonal line that can be rotated 90 degrees for orienting its polar counterpart.

## Joins

## Serifs

Serifs are joins that are paired together and reduced in size at the termination of a body. 1x1 joins used as serifs are reduced to 25% width. 1x2 joins used as serifs are reduced to 50% width.
